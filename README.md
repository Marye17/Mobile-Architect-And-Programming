Inventory App: Stockpile

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
Stockpile was built to help manage large inventories. It allows users to enter inventory items and their quantities, then set alerts for when those levels drop too low.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
While designing, my goal is to always keep things decluttered and organized so that users don't have to spend much time hunting for thier action buttons. This application
required a log in screen, an inventory display screen, an add an item screen, and a notification permisions screen.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I tried to keep the code clear and include comments where helpful.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Manually and frequently. After each major code addition, I ran the project to ensure it was working as expected. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
On the development phase. I learned alot about Android!

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The database connections made the most sense to me.
